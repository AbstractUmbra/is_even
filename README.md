# Is Even

A small, asynchronous and intelligent API to tell you if a provided integer is even, or not!

This is currently running [here](https://is-even.herokuapp.com/12).

A typical API response will be the following format:

```json
{
    "number": 12,
    "is_even": true
}
```


This entire repository and it's usage is satirical.
