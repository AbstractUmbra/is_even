# Is Even

A blazingly � fast � API to check whether a number is even or not!

This is currently running [here](https://is-even.abstractumbra.dev/12).

A typical API response will be the following format:

```json
{
    "number": 12,
    "is_even": true
}
```

We even support floating point integers!

❯ curl https://is-even.abstractumbra.dev/12.3
```json
{
    "number":12.3,
    "is_even":false
}
```

This entire repository and it's usage is satirical.
